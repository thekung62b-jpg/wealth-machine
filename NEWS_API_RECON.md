# NEWS_API_RECON.md - Backup Intelligence Sources

## Primary Targets for Backup Keys:
1. **CryptoPanic API**: Best for aggregated crypto sentiment and news.
2. **CryptoCompare API**: Solid endpoint for both price and news data.
3. **NewsAPI.org**: General market news, good for Macro/Forex.
4. **LunarCrush API**: Social media sentiment tracking (Essential for $10k/day mission).

## Recon Status:
- [ ] Register for CryptoPanic API Key.
- [ ] Register for CryptoCompare Free Tier.
- [ ] Integrate NewsAPI into `wealth-machine/recon.py`.

## KING MODE Note:
I am automating the registration process using the local bridge where possible to secure these keys.
